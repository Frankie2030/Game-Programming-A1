## Rubric Requirements Implementation Mapping

### 1. Background with Multiple Zombie Spawn Locations (2 pts)

**Requirement**: Provide a background scene with several distinct positions where zombies can appear. Recommendation: at least 6 clearly separated spawn points distributed across the playfield.

**Implementation**:
- **Files**: `main.py`, `models.py`, `constants.py`
- **Classes**: `Game`, `SpawnPoint`
- **Methods**: 
  - `Game.make_spawn_points()` (lines 212-253)
  - `Game.load_background()` (lines 193-210)
- **Details**: 
  - **20 spawn points** arranged in a **4×5 grid** (exceeds requirement of 6)
  - Background image: `assets/game_background.png` with tombstone graphics
  - Spawn points positioned at pixel coordinates aligned with tombstones
  - Responsive positioning that scales with window resizing
  - SpawnPoint model with position and radius attributes

**Key Code Locations**:
```python
# main.py - make_spawn_points()
cols, rows = 5, 4  # 5 columns, 4 rows = 20 total spawn points
start_x, start_y = 160, 75
x_gap, y_gap = 155, 115
```

### 2. Zombie Design (Sprite/Art) (1 pt)

**Requirement**: Include a distinct zombie visual (head or full body). Ensure consistent art style; credit sources if you use third-party assets.

**Implementation**:
- **Files**: `zombie.py`, `constants.py`
- **Classes**: `Zombie`
- **Methods**: 
  - `Zombie.load_sprites()` (class method, lines 55-104)
  - `Zombie.get_current_sprite()` (lines 398-414)
- **Assets**: `assets/ZombieSprite_166x144.png` - sprite sheet with multiple zombie states
- **Details**:
  - Multiple animated sprite frames for different states (normal, attack, death)
  - Sprite sheet parsing with 11×12 grid layout
  - Scaled sprites (base 80×70 pixels, scaled by 1.35×)
  - Consistent pixel art style throughout

**Key Code Locations**:
```python
# zombie.py - sprite loading
normal_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]
attack_positions = [(4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]
death_positions = [(0, 10), (1, 10), (2, 10), (3, 10)]
```

### 3. Zombie Head Display and Lifetime (1-2 pts)

**Requirement**: 
- 1 pt: The zombie head appears and persists until hit (no auto-disappear)
- 2 pts: The zombie head has a timer and automatically disappears after a set duration

**Implementation** (2 pts achieved):
- **Files**: `zombie.py`, `spawner.py`, `constants.py`
- **Classes**: `Zombie`, `Spawner`
- **Methods**: 
  - `Zombie.update()` (lines 158-179)
  - `Zombie.draw_timer_bar()` (lines 416-443)
  - `Spawner.maybe_spawn()` (lines 77-111)
- **Details**:
  - **Timer-based system**: Zombies have configurable lifetime (800-2000ms range)
  - **Visual timer bar** above each zombie showing remaining time
  - **Level-based scaling**: Lifetime decreases as level increases
  - **Auto-attack**: Zombies attack when timer expires (if not hit)
  - **Animation states**: Spawn → Active → Attack/Hit → Despawn

**Key Code Locations**:
```python
# constants.py
MAX_LIFETIME_MS = 2000
MIN_LIFETIME_MS = 800
LEVEL_LIFETIME_DECREASE = 100  # ms per level

# spawner.py - lifetime calculation
lifetime = MAX_LIFETIME_MS - (level - 1) * LEVEL_LIFETIME_DECREASE
lifetime = max(MIN_ZOMBIE_LIFETIME, lifetime)
```

### 4. Mouse Interaction / Hit Detection (3 pts)

**Requirement**: Capture mouse click events at coordinates (x, y). Determine whether the click hits the zombie's head (use a hitbox or pixel-perfect test). Prevent double-counting on a single click; ignore clicks while animations are finishing.

**Implementation**:

  - `Zombie.get_hitbox_rect()` (lines 488-499)
  - `Brain.contains_point()` (lines 178-183)
- **Details**:
  - **Rectangle-based hitbox detection** for precise collision
  - **Priority system**: Brain pickups checked before zombies
  - **State-based protection**: No hits during attack animations
  - **Single-hit prevention**: Zombies marked as hit immediately
  - **Comprehensive logging**: All clicks logged with coordinates and results
  - **Debug mode**: Visual hitbox display (press 'B')

**Key Code Locations**:
```python
# zombie.py - hitbox calculation
def get_hitbox_rect(self, now_ms: int) -> pygame.Rect:
    sprite_width, sprite_height = self._scaled_size()
    hitbox_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, int(sprite_width * 0.5), int(sprite_height * 0.9))
    hitbox_rect.centerx = center[0]
    hitbox_rect.centery = center[1] + vertical_offset
    return hitbox_rect

# main.py - click handling with priority
for brain in reversed(self.brains):  # Check brains first
    if brain.contains_point(pos): ...
for z in reversed(self.zombies):     # Then check zombies
    if z.contains_point(pos, now_ms): ...
```

### 5. Score Output (HUD) (1-2 pts)

**Requirement**: 
- 1 pt: Display either hits or misses
- 2 pts: Display both hits and misses, and show a differential or ratio (accuracy percent)

**Implementation** (2 pts achieved):
- **Files**: `ui.py`, `main.py`
- **Classes**: `HUD`, `Game`
- **Methods**: 
  - `HUD.draw()` (lines 55-161)

  - **Level progression**: Current level and progress toward next level
  - **Lives system**: Visual brain icons showing remaining lives
  - **Responsive layout**: Left/right split design that adapts to window size
  - **Additional metrics**: Level, zombies killed progress
  - **Real-time updates**: All stats update immediately on game events

**Key Code Locations**:
```python
# ui.py - comprehensive stats display
def draw(self, surf, hits, misses, lives, level, show_fps, fps, paused, muted):
    total = hits + misses
    acc = (hits / total * 100.0) if total > 0 else 0.0
    
    right_stats = [
        f"Hits: {hits}",
        f"Misses: {misses}",
        f"Accuracy: {acc:.1f}%",
    ]
```

## Architecture and Design

### File Structure and Responsibilities

```
A1/
├── main.py          # Main game controller and loop
├── constants.py     # Configuration and game constants
├── models.py        # Data structures (SpawnPoint)
├── spawner.py       # Zombie and brain spawning logic
├── zombie.py        # Zombie entity and behavior
├── brain.py         # Brain pickup entity
├── ui.py           # HUD and game over screen
├── logger.py       # Game event logging system
└── assets/         # Game assets (sprites, audio, backgrounds)
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Entity-Component Pattern**: Separate entities (Zombie, Brain) with distinct behaviors
2. **State Machine**: Zombie lifecycle states (spawning, active, attacking, despawn)
3. **Observer Pattern**: Event logging system tracks all game events
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Level-based difficulty scaling
5. **Responsive Design**: All UI elements scale with window size

### Technical Features

1. **Frame-rate Independence**: All timing uses milliseconds via `pygame.time.get_ticks()`
2. **Pause System**: Game time excludes paused duration
3. **Window Resizing**: Full responsive support with entity relocation
4. **Debug Features**: Hitbox visualization, FPS display, debug logging
5. **Robust Asset Loading**: Graceful fallbacks when assets are missing

## Potential Lecturer Questions and Answers

### Q1: "How do you ensure spawn points don't overlap with active zombies?"

**Answer**: The `Spawner.get_available_spawn_points()` method maintains a set of occupied spawn points by checking all active zombies and brains. Only unoccupied spawn points are eligible for new spawns.

**Code Reference**: `spawner.py`, lines 53-75

### Q2: "How is the game timing independent of frame rate?"

**Answer**: All game logic uses `pygame.time.get_ticks()` for millisecond-precise timing. The `Game.get_game_time()` method provides pause-aware timing that excludes time spent paused. Entity updates, spawning, and animations all use this consistent time source.

**Code Reference**: `main.py`, lines 134-152

### Q3: "How do you prevent double-counting clicks on zombies?"

**Answer**: Multiple mechanisms prevent double-counting:
1. Zombies are marked as `hit` immediately when clicked
2. The `contains_point()` method returns False for already-hit zombies
3. Zombies in attack state cannot be hit
4. The click handler processes zombies in reverse order and returns immediately after the first hit

**Code Reference**: `zombie.py`, lines 501-508; `main.py`, lines 692-711

### Q4: "How does the level progression system work?"

**Answer**: Level progression is based on zombies killed (hits). Every 10 zombies killed advances the level (up to level 10). Each level increase:
- Reduces spawn interval by 50ms
- Reduces zombie lifetime by 100ms
- Awards +1 bonus life (capped at max lives)
- Plays level-up sound effect

**Code Reference**: `main.py`, lines 154-176; `constants.py`, lines 40-45

### Q5: "How do you handle window resizing while maintaining game state?"

**Answer**: The `handle_resize()` method:
1. Recalculates spawn points for new dimensions
2. Relocates existing entities to corresponding new positions
3. Updates entity scaling factors
4. Reloads background image at new size
5. Updates font sizes for responsive text

**Code Reference**: `main.py`, lines 300-407

### Q6: "How is the accuracy percentage calculated?"

**Answer**: Accuracy = (hits / (hits + misses)) × 100. The calculation handles edge cases (division by zero when no clicks have occurred) and displays real-time updates in the HUD.

**Code Reference**: `ui.py`, lines 59-60

### Q7: "How do you ensure zombies appear at the correct tombstone locations?"

**Answer**: Spawn points use hardcoded pixel coordinates that align with the background tombstone image. The coordinates are calculated with:
- Base positions for 960×540 reference size
- Responsive scaling factors for different window sizes
- Grid-based positioning (4 rows × 5 columns)

**Code Reference**: `main.py`, lines 234-247

### Q8: "How does the audio system work?"

**Answer**: The audio system initializes pygame.mixer and loads optional audio assets. It supports:
- Background music with volume control
- Sound effects with separate volume control
- Mute/unmute functionality
- Graceful handling of missing audio files

**Code Reference**: `main.py`, lines 255-298

### Q9: "How do you implement the zombie timer bars?"

**Answer**: Each zombie tracks its `born_at` timestamp and `lifetime` duration. The `draw_timer_bar()` method calculates remaining time, displays a colored progress bar (green→yellow→red), and positions it above each zombie.

**Code Reference**: `zombie.py`, lines 416-443

### Q10: "How does the brain pickup system work?"

**Answer**: The `Spawner` periodically checks for brain spawning (every 4 seconds) with 25% probability. Brains:
- Spawn at available locations (not occupied by zombies)
- Have their own lifetime and fade animations
- Award +1 life when clicked (capped at max lives)
- Are processed with higher priority than zombie clicks

**Code Reference**: `spawner.py`, lines 113-142; `brain.py`
